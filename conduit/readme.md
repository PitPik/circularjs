> ### [CircularJS](https://github.com/PitPik/circularjs) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://pitpik.github.io/circularjs/conduit/src)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/PitPik/circularjs)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **CircularJS** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **CircularJS** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works


[CircularJS](https://github.com/PitPik/circularjs) lets you write small and fast components and modules.
```components/main-app/main-app.component.js``` is the starting point with its state model and a router that switches the state. The change of the state causes the moduleLoader to fetches the components and renders them in the dedicated container `<app-outlet></app-outlet>`.

All the modules again use components to render the templates.

There is a central data service ```js/api.service.js``` that provides all the REST calls needed for the modules for getting and setting data to and from the server.

The "live" example is packed with CirculaJS `package.js` including the `circular.min.js` file (option -cr) and measures only 95k not compressed (31k gZip).

# Getting started

Put folder inside your server's documents root and run it (no npm, no dependencies, plain old JS).

The current setup is meant for performance, not for development which can be changed as follows.

 - Open ```index.html```, uncomment `<script type="text/javascript" src='../circular.min.js'></script>`, then go to the bottom and switch commenting to the 3 script tags. Voil√°, you're ready to develop.

# Conceptional mistake in this approach

In this approach (was done quick and dirty) are fundamental mistakes in architecture.
`main-app.component.js` is only delegating views according to the router and keeping track of the user and the active link. This way, the components get loaded before there is any data here. This way, we need to have api loaded in every component to get the current data. This looks also odd as we see the view (still old data),... and then it all of a sudden changes...

A better approach would be to first get the data and `then()` switch with `renderModule()`, passing the retrived data to the components and let them only render them. `renderModule()` has nice options for making cool transitions.

This way we also don't need to keep track of router parameter states in each and every component. The whole app would be shorter and easier maintainable. All other components only do rendering and event handling,... nothing else.


# Some additions to the [original implementation](https://demo.realworld.io)

 - URL2State "Your Feed" + pagination (browser BACK button gets you back to where you were)
 - URL2State "Global Feed" + pagination
 - URL2State "Tags" + pagination
 - URL2State "My Articles" + pagination
 - URL2State "Favorited Articles" + pagination
 - "Preview Article", "Edit Article" toggle buttons to preview article as rendered markdown
 - Tags in article list and article view are clickable
 - Post dates are rendered in the browser's language format (very slow though)
 - Soft transitions between data load / app re-render (to demo how transitions work in CircularJS)
 - App icon and metadata to install app on an iPad as web-app (demonstrates CircularJS working perfectly for mobile)
