  <h2>Demo of the demos</h2>
  <p>This demo shows how the demo app itself is working, so what you're just seeing.</p>
  <p>This <strong>demo</strong> is driven by a <strong>navigation</strong> that also shows its <strong>state</strong> and an <strong>outlet</strong> that shows the pages controlled by the menu, that again show the individual demos like this you just see.</p>
  <p>To set up this demo we use a <strong>navigation component 'demo-nav'</strong> with a <strong>state controller</strong>, a <strong>router</strong> and a <strong>dynamic component loader</strong>. As you can see with the attribute <strong>cr-lazy</strong> components can be lazy loaded.</p>
