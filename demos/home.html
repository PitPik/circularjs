  <h2>Demo of the demos</h2>
  <p>This demo shows how the demo app itself is working, so what you're just seeing.</p>
  <p>This <strong>demo</strong> is driven by a <strong>navigation</strong> that also shows its <strong>state</strong> and an <strong>outlet</strong> that shows the pages controlled by the menu, that show the individual demos like this you just see.</p>
  <p>To set up this demo we use a <strong>navigation component 'demo-nav'</strong> with a <strong>state controller</strong>, a <strong>router</strong> and a <strong>dynamic component loader</strong>. As you can see with the attribute <strong>cr-lazy</strong> components can be lazy loaded.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript code">ss</code></pre>
  <p>...and here is the HTML</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html html">ss</code></pre>
  <p>All the modules are actually individual HTML pages that are loaded via <code>circular.createComponent()</code> into <code>&lt;div class="module-outlet">&lt;/div></code> and can therefor also be called as web-pages/widgets without the surrounding app. Those modules can be developed independently.</p>
