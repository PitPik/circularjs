# CircularJS

CircularJS is a tiny MVC like framework. It's goal is to help building web-apps in a model-oriented easy way by building fast and convenient 2-way data binding.
CircularJS provides you with:

* VOM (Virtual Object Model),
* Schnauzer, a tiny and fast Mustache/Handlebars like template rendering engine (can be replaced),
* a event-listener controller,
* DOMinator, a controller that automatically syncs the VOM model with the real DOM.

CircularJS combines all those tools to easily abstract app modules
