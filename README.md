# CircularJS

CircularJS is a tiny MVC like framework (~5.5kBytes). It's goal is to help building web-apps in a model-oriented easy way by building fast and convenient 2-way data binding.

## CircularJS provides you with:

* VOM, a Virtual Object Model controller that automatically reacts on changes of properties on the model,

* an event-listener controller for all UI actions an any other events that installs automatically,
* DOMinator, a controller that automatically syncs the VOM model with the real DOM.

CircularJS combines all those components to easily abstract app modules and build high performance SPAs.
CircularJS is very small (~5.5kBytes gZip) and fast and therefore the best joice for mobile apps.

The intention to build CircularJS was to create something small and fast that is easy to learn and feels closer to javaScript rather than having to learn a new language or complicated patterns. Using CircularJS is quite easy and ...
