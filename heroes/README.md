# Tutorial: Tour of Heroes

The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Circular.
In this tutorial you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

By the end of the tutorial you will be able to do the following:

 - Use built-in Circular functionality to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
 - Create Circular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
 - Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
 - Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
 - Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
 - Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
 - Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
 - Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
 - You'll learn enough Circular to get started and gain confidence that Circular can do whatever you need it to do.
